# Common coding recipies - backend

## Creating a new layer type

1. start in the Frontend by adding a new layer type.
2. Add the type to: `LayerType.kt` . Compiling will force you to add necessary code for the new type. Keep it minimal, don't add any attributes or logic, just make it compile
3. Go back to the frontend.

When the layer is added to the frontend, you can implement it fully in the backend. Add the attributes and logic where needed to make this layer work.
