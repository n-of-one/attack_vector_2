## Overview
Players hack sites and break ICE (protection systems) by solving puzzle mini-games in order to uncover clues put there by the game masters. Emphasis is on the multiplayer aspect, players are stimulated to work as a team, not as individuals.

Players will need a laptop and a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to play the game. It will not work on a mobile phone.

There is a short video that showcases aspects of Attack Vector on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOkPB3ZrHqM).

## Player

## Game master
