# Tar ICE
This ICE has no minigame and it just takes time to (auto)hack.

High level Tar ICE takes hours or even day to hack. So it will be clear to hackers that they need to find an alternative way to bypass this ICE. 

See the hack timings [here](../../player/ICE/Tar%20ICE#ice-strength). Any Tar ICE with a difficulty of Strong or higher is not meant to be hacked through normal means.

## Uses of Tar ICE

### Forcing to find a way around
You can add a keystore layer that has the password for the Tar ICE, and the players need to gain access to that keystore. You can also create multiple routes through the site, blocking some with tar ICE.

### Calling all hackers
Because Tar ICE hack time reduces with more hackers, it can also be used to force hackers to collaborate on hacking this single piece of ICE

### Impenetrable
The final use of Tar is to create an impenetrable layer of ICE. Sometimes you want to have a site that players just can't hack. But they are welcome to find out that this is not possible. Adding a few layers of Very Hard or Onyx Tar ICE will get the message across.

Note that if the players have access to scripts, you may need to add multiple layers of Tar ICE to prevent them from ever hacking through.
