# Introduction
Players hack sites to uncover information. Learn more about creating sites [here](basic%20site%20design/Creating%20a%20site).

When you want your players to be able to hack your site, you first need to make it hackable. More information [here](Making%20a%20site%20hackable).

Once you have accumulated several sites, you might want to perform site management. Like downloading sites for backup or removing old sites. More information [here](Managing%20sites).
