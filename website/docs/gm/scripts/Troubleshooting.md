# Troubleshooting
Things can go wrong with scripts or script credits. Especially if players are new, they might make mistakes while they are learning how it all works. Meanwhile their characters might be seasoned hackers who would not make simple mistakes.

These are some tools you have as a game master to deal with this.

## Fixing a player's scripts
You can go to the page **Scripts** and then to **Current scripts**. Here you can change exactly what scripts a player has. You can also load and unload scripts from memory without having to wait until memory is refreshed, or until scripts can be loaded again.

This is also useful if you -as a game master- want to experiment with scripts and want to give yourself a bunch of scripts to play around with.

## Fixing script credits
There are two ways to change a player's credit balance.

You can go to the page **Scripts** and then to **Hacker credits**. Here you can perform transactions as the (system). These will show up in the transaction history.

You can also override the current scripts credit balance of a player. Go to the **Users** page and edit the balance there. This will not show up in the transaction history.
