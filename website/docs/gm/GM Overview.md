# GM Overview
As a game master you will create sites for your players to hack.
There is a visual editor for this. See [here](sites/Introduction).

Alternatively you can make ICE puzzles or switches available directly as standalone items. See [here](standalone/Standalone%20apps).

If your Larp uses skills, you may have to manage the skills of the players. See [here](gm/users/Managing%20Skills).

If your larp uses scripts, you may have to manage the scripts that exist, or that players have access to. See: [here](gm/scripts/Role%20of%20scripts)
