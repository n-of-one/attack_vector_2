# Managing users
As a GM you can manage the users of the system on the **Users** page.

Click on any user to bring up their details:

| Attribute      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name           | This is the hacker name, or online alias. Other hackers will see this name when they hack together. If you want to log in as a hacker, use this name as the login name.           |
| Type           | Account type, see the section on user types ([here](#account-types)).                                                                                                             |
| Character name | This is the name of the character that this account is for. This is optional and can be used to keep track of hacker accounts without having to store player names in the system. |
| Icon           | The image the hacker is represented with in a site.                                                                                                                               |
| Script credits | Current balance of script credits of this player. See the section on script credits ([here](#script-credits)).                                                                    |
| Skills         | See the page on skills ([here](/gm/users/Managing%20skills)).                                                                                                                     |

## Account types
These are the account types

| Type        | Purpose                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Hacker      | Player account                             |
| Game master | Game master account                        |
| Admin       | Account used for configuring Attack Vector |

By default new accounts are hacker accounts. You can change the account type to make someone a game master or an admin.

## Fixed accounts
There are a number of fixed accounts that cannot be renamed or changed.

| Account  | purpose                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| template | This is the template for all new hacker accounts, see the skills page for details ([here](/gm/users/Managing%20skills)). |
| gm       | This is the fixed game master account.                                                                                   |
| admin    | This is the fixed admin account.                                                                                         |

The 'gm' and 'admin' accounts exist so you cannot accidentally remove your own access to Attack Vector. Use the generic login for them, see [here](/gm/GM%20login#generic-login).

## Script credits
If the hacker account does not have the 'Script credits' skill, the credits cannot be accessed by the player.

There are two ways to change how many credits a player has. You can change the value here. This will set the new amount, without showing up in the transaction history of the player. Use this to correct mistakes that you don't want to show up in game.

Alternatively, you can go to the **Scripts** page and then to the **hacker credits** page. Here you can adjust the credits and this will show up in their transaction log. Use this for in-game purposes such as paying a hacker for services rendered.
