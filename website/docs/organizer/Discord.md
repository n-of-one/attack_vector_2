## Feature request for new ICE puzzles
I very much want to add more ICE puzzles, to create more variety. But it takes a long time to add a single puzzle. So these are the requirements for me considering a new type of puzzle:

- It must be fun to solve alone
- It must be fun to solve as a group
- It must be possible to create different difficulty levels
- The puzzle must be able to be created by an algorithm

If there is a sufficiently large number of existing puzzles of various difficulty levels, that would also work. These existing puzzles would need to be open-source, compatible with the MIT license of Attack Vector.
