# Hosting
Attack Vector is free, but it's also a piece of software that needs to be hosted somewhere.

Attack Vector is designed to be run as a server that can be accessed over the internet. It can be run on an offline computer (accessible only via the local network) but this stops Google authentication from working.

The simplest option is to just install it on a laptop or desktop. 

Another option is to host it on the cloud. It runs on an Amazon AWS t4g.micro, costing around 1 dollar-cent/euro-cent per hour. There are additional costs for having an IP address and having a domain name.

For details on installation, see [here](/installation).
