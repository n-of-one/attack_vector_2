# Customization
Attack Vector 2 can be changed to fit the aesthetic of a specific event, but this will require some development: editing css files.

I am happy to perform some simple changes as long as the organization provides the graphics and cooperates in this process.

A bigger effort is to connect the login of Attack Vector to the login of the event's website. I will help with this depending on the effort involved.
