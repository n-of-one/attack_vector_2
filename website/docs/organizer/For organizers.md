# For organizers
Version 2 of Attack Vector is meant to be low effort for larp organizers to use. It's been developed for the Dutch Larp [Eos Frontier](https://eosfrontier.space/), but it can be used in any sci-fi event that favors player involvement over realism.

Attack Vector is [open source](https://github.com/n-of-one/attack_vector_2) under the MIT license, meaning you can use it in most ways you want, including commercially.
