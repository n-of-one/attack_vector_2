## Minigame
Word search ICE is the classic word search puzzle.

The words can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The words can be read in any direction.

Letters of the words to guess can overlap with letters of a word that has already been guessed. Very rarely this can be a 100% overlap.

## ICE strength

The strength of the ICE determines the size of the letter grid, the amount of words and the length of the words.

| Strength    | Size  | Words | Word length |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| Very weak   | 13x13 | 5     | 6-8         |
| Weak        | 15x15 | 7     | 5-12        |
| Average     | 20x20 | 8     | 4-12        |
| Strong      | 30x22 | 15    | 3-10        |
| Very strong | 40x24 | 20    | 3-8         |
| Onyx        | 50x28 | 25    | 3-6         |

The strength has no impact on the direction or overlap of the words.

## Multiplayer

Multiple players can look for words together on the same screen. This is the ICE that benefits most from other players helping that are not hackers. Anyone can try to find words.

To maximize multiplayer potential, a hacker can hook their laptop to a large screen or projector and let other players help.
