# Buying scripts
If you have the 'Script credits' skill, you can buy scripts with credits (⚡). You will have a page **Market** where you can spend the credits.

Here you can buy scripts with the credits you have. What scripts are offered here, depends on your Larp.

Scripts expire every morning at 06:00, but your script credits never expire. So you can buy scripts just before starting a hacking run.
