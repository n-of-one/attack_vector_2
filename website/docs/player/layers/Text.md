This represent an application of the site. For example a database.
Hacking this layers reveals information found in that application, or has an effect in the game world.

```
⇋ view 
Node service layers: 
0 OS 
1 Database 

⇋ hack 1 
Hacked: 1 Database 
Database: 
- No records found. 
Database logs:
- delete all records (user: x44)
```

In this example the players learn that it was user x44 that deleted all database records.

## Effect in the game world
There is no mechanism in Attack Vector to signal to a game master that this layer has been hacked. So if hacking this layer indicates that an effect in the real world, then either a game master needs to see that you hack it, or you need to inform a game master of this yourself.
