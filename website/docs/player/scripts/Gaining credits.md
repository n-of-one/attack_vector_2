# Gaining credits
The main way to gain credits is by stealing data and selling it to a data broker.

While in a site, you can come across a layer that contains valuable data. If you have the 'Script credits' skill, you can steal that data and sell it. Stealing and selling is automated, you just need to hack the layer that contains the application with the data.

```
⇋ view
Node service layers:
0 OS
1 Mailserver

⇋ hack 1
Valuable data found, worth 10⚡. Sending to data broker.
Clearing data from layer...

Done.
```

This data can only be sold once. So the next player that hacks this layer will not find any data to steal.

```
⇋ hack 1
No data of value found.
Logs indicate data has recently been deleted.
```

If you don't have the 'Script credits' skill, you will see the following:
```
⇋ hack 3 
Valuable data found. 

Unknown encryption detected. (Missing skill)
