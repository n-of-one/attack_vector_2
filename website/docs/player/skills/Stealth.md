# Stealth
This skill increases the timer when you trigger a tripwire. A stealth value of +30% means that the total time is increased by 30%. For example from 10 minutes to 13 minutes.

This skill can also be applied negatively, to decrease the time. A stealth value of -30% will decrease the time from 10 minutes to 7 minutes.

This skill has no effect if the timer is already started by another player.
