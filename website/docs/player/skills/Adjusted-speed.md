# Adjusted speed
This skill indicates that you are either faster or slower than other hackers.

Your speed defines three things:

- It determines how fast text appears in the terminal.
- It determines how fast you move between nodes.
- It determines how fast you start an attack.

The default for Attack Vector is 4, but this can be changed by the system admin, see [here](../../../installation/Configuration#default-speed).
