# Create site

This skill allows you to create your own sites. Other hackers can then hack these sites as normal. Your sites can represent in-game systems you own. You can also create in-game tutorials for other players.

When you have this skill, you will see a page **sites** that allows you to manage your sites.

See the GM section on more details on site design and managing sites, [here](/gm/sites/Introduction).
