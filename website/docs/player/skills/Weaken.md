# Weaken
This skill allows you to use the `weaken` command. This reduces the strength of a single layer of ICE. The strength is reduced by one step, for example Average becomes Weak.

You can use this skill once per site. However, you can use the skill again if the site is reset. It's also possible to have this skill multiple times.

For each instance of this skill you have, it is defined on what types of ICE it will work on. This can be more than one type of ICE. For example, if you have a weaken skill that affects Tangle and Minesweeper ICE, it can be used to either weaken a layer of Tangle or a layer of minesweeper ICE.
