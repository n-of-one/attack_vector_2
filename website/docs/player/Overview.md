# Overview

As a player you are a hacker that can infiltrate the computer systems of the game world. These systems are called **sites** in Attack Vector. Once you know the name of a site, you can hack it. You find the site names in the game world, or receive them from a game master.

A site consists of **nodes** that are connected to each other. The general goal is to progress deeper into a site and find information hidden in nodes.

This site contains 6 nodes. The red frog diamond indicates where your position in the site is. The yellow diamond is another hacker.

## Nodes and layers
Each node contains one or more layers. You can inspect the layers by clicking on a node on the map.

This node contains 4 layers (0-3)
- Layer 3 is an HR database that can be hacked to find information about employees.
- Layer 2 is an ICE layer that can be hacked by playing a mini-game: word search.
- Layers 1 and 0 are shielded by the ICE layer, so you cannot see what they are.

More info: [Layers](Layers)

## Terminal
Hacking a site is done by entering the commands in the terminal. There are only a few commands to learn like "move" or "hack". You can always use the command 'help' to see the available commands.

More info: [Terminal commands](Terminal%20commands)

## ICE Puzzles
Hacking ICE is done by solving puzzle mini-games:
- [Word search](ICE/Word%20Search%20ICE.md)
- [Tangle](ICE/Tangle%20ICE.md)
- [Netwalk](ICE/Netwalk%20ICE.md)
- [Minesweeper](ICE/Minesweeper%20ICE)
- [Password](ICE/Password%20ICE)
- [Tar](ICE/Tar%20ICE)

## Skills
Skills allow some hackers to be better at hacking than others. 
More details can be found [here](Skills).

Check with your organizers which skills are available.

## Scripts
Scripts are one-time-use programs that assist you during hacking runs. 
More details can be found [here](Scripts/Scripts%20Overview).

Check with your organizers if scripts are used on your Larp.
