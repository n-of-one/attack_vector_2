The game has multiple (competing) design goals:

- The main game interface (terminal, manage hacker stuff, hack) is meant to be run from a computer/laptop
- Ice should be hackable from a phone (if feasable)

Ice games run in a separate browser window, so the layout can be different from the main interface.


The UI is designed to fit within a 1920x1080 resolution monitor running a default windows + chrome setup

Windows: toolbar on the bottom, height 1
Chrome: Not maximized, toolbar and button bar visible

This gives us effectively 1920x937 pixels. Accounting for a scroll bar and rounding down, we are left with:

Screen real estate: 1900x930.

For mobile:

Screen size
Getting a good screen size for a puzzle vitally important if you want to run the same puzzle on a phone as well as a computer.

Phone resolutions differ a lot, but fortunately viewport resolutions are somewhat standardized to a 9:16 aspect ratio.
In 2020 many devices support a viewport size of 360 x 640

The screen is divided into a top section of 40 px high to display some name of the puzzle, as well as an optional button to request full screen on a mobile.
This top section also holds navigation (i.e. exit puzzle)
The rest of the screen is reserved for the puzzle canvas (pixijs).

The generic size of the canvas is 360 x 600, but this is stretched to fill the remaining screen size.

This generic size of 360 x 600 is what all puzzles are designed for.
