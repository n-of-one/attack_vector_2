The game has multiple (competing) design goals:

- The main game interface (terminal, manage hacker stuff, hack) is meant to be run from a computer/laptop
- Ice should be hackable from a phone (if feasable)

Ice games run in a separate browser window, so the layout can be different from the main interface.


The UI is designed to fit within a 1920x1080 resolution monitor running a default windows + chrome setup

Windows: toolbar on the bottom, height 1
Chrome: Not maximized, toolbar and button bar visible

This gives us effectively 1920x937 pixels. Accounting for a scroll bar and rounding down, we are left with:

Screen real estate: 1900x930.
