CLient-server interaction
-------------------------


AV2 is a full multiplayer game. Players can enter and exit at any time and the game state must be consistent for everyone.

Principles
----------

1. Server holds the game state

Everything relevant to game state is stored by the server. Clients send commands to the server, and the server then informs the clients of the changed game state.

Example:
Client sends to server: ~"Command: hack 1"
Server sends to all clients: ~"hacker 02389 has hacked layer 1 of node 0333-3939"


2. No transition states

Because clients can enter and exit at any time, the complexity becomes very high if there are intermediate game states. For example a hacker slowly
moving from node 00 to 01 is an intermediate game state. When a new hacker enters the run, what do they see: the player at node 00 or at 01 or moving from 00 to 01?

This will be solved by preventing the situation altogether, and replacing it with slightly different action: the hacker initiates a move from 00 to 01.
Visually this will look like a connection being established from 00 to 01, and when the connection is established, the hacker icon will quickly move from 00 to 01.

The connection that is being established, is a private thing for the hacker. Nobody else will see this, and it will affect nothing else. The hacker is still at node 00.
When the connection is completely established, the player will instantly move to node 01 (game state) and (visually) will quickly move from 00 to 01.
