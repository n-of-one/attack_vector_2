So which other events are available in Fabric?
Well, from mouse-level ones there are "mouse:down", "mouse:move", and "mouse:up".
From generic ones, there are "after:render".
Then there are selection-related events: "before:selection:cleared", "selection:created", "selection:cleared".
And finally, object ones: "object:modified", "object:selected", "object:moving", "object:scaling", "object:rotating", "object:added", and "object:removed"

From the docs in the code (1.7.2) :

   * @fires object:added
   * @fires object:modified
   * @fires object:rotating
   * @fires object:scaling
   * @fires object:moving
   * @fires object:selected
   *
   * @fires before:selection:cleared
   * @fires selection:cleared
   * @fires selection:created

   * @fires path:created
