                    <p className="text">
                        As a game master you create the sites for your players to play with. You do this using a visual editor.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        <WebsiteImage path="/img/website/gm/editor.png" alt="A picture of the site editor"/><br/>
                        <br/>
                        You can use drag and drop to add new nodes, add layers and enter the info that players can find in the site.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="muted">Creating complex sites</h3>
                    <p className="text">
                        Creating a simple site with some ICE to hack, and some info to find is easy.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Creating a more complex site with passwords scattered throughout,
                        countdown timers to beat, and meta puzzles involving other elements from your setting, well that will take some more effort.
                        But ultimately the most fun can be had by tailoring your site to your event and players.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        There is the option to export and import sites, so you can collaborate with other game masters or organizers to create sites.<br/><br/>
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="muted">Scripts</h3>
                    <p className="text">
                        Scripts are an optional feature that give hackers run-once programs to help them hack sites.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        See this video for an explanation of how to manage scripts: <a href="https://youtu.be/3BBU9aGHK6U" target="_blank">Youtube</a>.<br/><br/>

                    <h3 className="muted">Interaction with the real world</h3>
                    <h5 className="muted">Password ICE</h5>
                    <p className="text">
                        The easiest way to force interaction with the real world is to use Password ICE and have the players find the password
                        somewhere outside of the digital world.<br/>
                        Password ICE has a 'hint' that can point players in the right direction.
                    </p>
                    <h5 className="muted">Switch and status light</h5>
                    <p className="text">
                        A more involved option is the the switch and status light layer<br/>
                        <br/>
                        <WebsiteImage path="/img/website/gm/status-light-red.png" alt="A picture of a status light"/><br/>
                        <br/>
                        The status light can be viewed on a different computer or phone (yes, this is meant for phones, unlike the rest of Attack Vector).<br/>
                        <br/>
                        When the hackers get access to the switch layer, they can flip the switch, and the color status light will change.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        <WebsiteImage path="/img/website/gm/switch.png" alt="A picture of a switch"/><br/>
                        <br/>
                        The status light could be displayed on a phone next to a door, to indicate to the players if the door is locked or unlocked. This way,
                        one group of players 'Ã­n the field' could need the hackers to unlock the door for them.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        <WebsiteImage path="/img/website/gm/status-light-green.png" alt="A picture of a switch"/><br/>
                        <br/>
                        The words on a switch & status light can be changed, so it can also be used disarm a trap, or turn off the life-support of a patient, etc.
