Looking at ways to run AV2 on the cloud:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/docker-on-aws/containers-orchestrations-on-aws.html


ECS + Fargate: https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/
- build your own docker image

EKS: https://aws.amazon.com/eks/




Apprunner: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/getting-started.html
- docker created by AWS
- automatic patching of docker OS (?)
