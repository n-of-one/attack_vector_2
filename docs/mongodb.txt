------------------
Using Robomongo to access the db and view/edit data, but do not use Robomongo to create users (known problem with authentication protocol vs jdbc drivers...)

Connections for Robomong:
As root:

address: 192.168.99.100 : 27017
Authentication: (none)


As av2:

address: 192.168.99.100 : 27017
Authentication: db: admin, username: av2, password: av2



------------------
Connection the application using environment variables, because that's how its done in the free hosting at Heroku


Environment variables for running on development machine: (where 192.168.99.100 is the ip address of the docker-machine)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://av2:av2@192.168.99.100/admin?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
ENVIRONMENT=dev-ervi
MONGODB_NAME=local


Environment variables for running on development machine with mongo on localhost
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://av2:av2@localhost/admin?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
ENVIRONMENT=dev-ervi
MONGODB_NAME=local
